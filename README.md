# Hotel-Booking-Project
•	Conducted an in-depth Hotel Booking Data Analysis using Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) in Jupyter Notebook, identifying key factors influencing reservation cancellations and customer booking behavior.
•	Discovered that higher pricing significantly contributes to cancellation rates and that cancellations peak in January, using insightful visualizations like bar graphs and line charts to support business recommendations.
•	Proposed actionable insights for pricing, seasonal promotions, and location-based strategies—such as targeted discounts and marketing campaigns—to help hotels reduce cancellations and optimize revenue.
